# google-webpage
#This is a google webpage that i just created as part of my microverse-precourse project!.
#Creating this page was quite difficult than anticipated and as i researched some stuff online for this webpage ended up learning some stuff that i didn't even know about.
#if you check it out you will see that the are some errors ,its because i'm still new to this but with a lot of practice i'll be alright 
#These are the things/tools that i used on the project:
#used pre-installed ubuntu text editor.
also,ofcourse, internet to download images(logo images).
